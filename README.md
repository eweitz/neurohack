# neurohack

[Neurohack](https://eweitz.github.io/neurohack/) is the output of a hackathon for [Visualizing Feedback of Brain Networks](https://nvite.com/NeuroViz/d632#details):

> "We are a team at National Institutes of Health developing a neurofeedback platform of whole brain networks. The output of our data gives us binary information every 2 seconds (either correct or incorrect brain state). We have a few brain computer interfaces developed, but we really need some creative help in thinking up dynamic stimuli that maintain attention over the course of 10 minute neurofeedback scans."

This work derives from [Random Traversal III](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11337835) by Mike Bostock.

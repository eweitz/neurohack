# neurohack

The [Neurohack](https://eweitz.github.io/neurohack/) web application was developing at the hackathon for [Visualizing Feedback of Brain Networks](https://nvite.com/NeuroViz/d632#details):

> "We are a team at National Institutes of Health developing a neurofeedback platform of whole brain networks. The output of our data gives us binary information every 2 seconds (either correct or incorrect brain state). We have a few brain computer interfaces developed, but we really need some creative help in thinking up dynamic stimuli that maintain attention over the course of 10 minute neurofeedback scans."
